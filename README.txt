It's a website for Omnifood restaurant. This project used to learn the Front-end part (HTML, CSS, and some JS) and some training with the Back-end (python and framework flask). All users' info is kept in the MongoDB database.
Implemented logic for users: sign in, sign up, and sign out. Also, users can choose a plan, pause, resume, and cancel it.

File db_host.txt was placed in .gitignore for more confidentiality.
